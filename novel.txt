He didn't know why they were there... but they were.

The three ghosts were staring at him across the table. Matt had been at the Bitmaker's lab for hours - it was sometime in the early morning. Maybe it was the lack of sleep, maybe it was the five cups of coffee, it didn't matter. What mattered now was that there were three spooky dudes seriously creeping Matt out.

Matt first rubbed his eyes, then pinched himself in disbelief thinking it was some caffeine induced daymare. When he felt the pain and realized that he was fully awake, his natural reaction was to push away from the table trying to create a safe distance between him and the apparitions. As every single ghost story or horror movie Matt had ever watched, he realized ghosts only make themselves known to people when they have unfinished business. Unable to determine whether their presence was benign or malignant, Matt quietly whispered into the echoing room - "What do you want with me?"
